# Nelnet Loan Pay

This script opens the Nelnet website and automatically pays whichever loan you specify.  I created it to make an extra payment on my highest interest student loan automatically every month (Nelnet doesn't let you schedule recurring payments to a specific loan).

To use, create a file named secrets.py and define the following variables:

username = [your Nelnet user name]

password = [your Nelnet password]

loanNum = [the loan number you'd like to pay]
